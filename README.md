<h3><b> Visualizing and classifying disaster-related Twitter media data to enhance situational awareness during disaster response. </b></h3>

Abstract 
<hr>
Social media feeds such as tweets are emerging as platforms contributing to situational awareness during disasters. Information shared on Twitter by both affected population (e.g., requestingassistance,warning)andthoseoutsidetheimpactzone (e.g., providing assistance) would help ﬁrst responders, decision makers and the public to understand the situation ﬁrst-hand. Timely analysis of disaster-relevant tweets requires an ability to automatically ﬁnd tweets related to a particular disaster. This problem is challenging as tweet messages are often short and unstructured, and learning-based approach for ﬁltering disasterrelated tweets may not provide satisfactory results. Thus, we propose a simple yet effective matching-based algorithm for ﬁltering relevant messages. To evaluate the two approaches, we putthemintoaframeworkproposedforanalyzingdiaster-related posts. Analysis results on ten datasets with various disaster types show the pros and cons of each approach.
